    <h1> Dogs </h1>
    <h1> Sarah Tubbs </h1>
    <p> I love dogs. I like all dog breeds, but especially german shepards and labs. </p>
    <p> I have a dog. Her name is Bailey. She is very smart and can do a lot of tricks. She is also very playful and fun. </p>
    <p> I like to volunteer at a dog shelter. I volunteer at Dog Orphans in Douglas. While I am there I walk dogs, play with dogs, and clean up their cages. </p>
